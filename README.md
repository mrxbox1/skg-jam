# a platformer (demo)
My submission for the Stop Killing Games Community Jam. The game is also available on itch.io, so check it out there if you want: https://blueice15.itch.io/skg-demo

## A little warning
The game may contain some spooks and jumpscares. If you think you won't be scared, wait 'till you see the code. It's horrendous.
